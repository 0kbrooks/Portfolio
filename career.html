          <h1>Computer science and me</h1><!--section 1-->
          <p class="lead">I have always loved <mark>computers</mark> and technology. Ever since I was a little kid I loved playing around with files and wondering how things worked. My father tought me a lot about <mark>computer science</mark>, and I tought myself the rest. <mark>Computer science</mark> showed me how to be resourceful and learn a lot of important skills.</p>
          <!--anticapitalist monologue--><p>I hope to use my knowledge and skills to land a good job. The reason I want a well paying job is to get enough money to win and escape the capitalist nightmare that our society has become. I will buy a share in the land that my father's family has in the Catskills in New york, and live my days quietly and peacefully, my human interaction mostly comprised of the employees at the cashier in the grocery store I visit weekly, or people at the Home Depot closest as I pick up whatever tools that I would need for my current building project. I would constantly build, expand, and repair the house on that property, with the help of perhaps my family. I would teach myself new skills, how to work with my hands, and gain strength and certainty in my physical capabilities. I will have won capitalism.</p>
