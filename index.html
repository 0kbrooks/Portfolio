                <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
                <p>I have always loved coding, and computer science in general. This Github site is a project for my Computer Science class, in which I have documented the career that I would like and the colleges that I would like to go to, as well as some things about them; For example, my college of choice is the University of Toronto, which I want to go to because it is in Canada, a place where I want to live, and is well ranked, and has a good employment rate, but my runner-up is the New Jersey City University, which I like for its weather and convenient location</p>
